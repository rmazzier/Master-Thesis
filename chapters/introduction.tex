STILL WIP
%This work of Thesis was conducted during my stage at Fondazione Bruno Kessler in Trento, Italy. During this experience, I worked alongside professor Luciano Serafini and researcher Alessandro Daniele in further experiments on Knowledge Enhanced Neural Networks, a special kind of Neural Network layer designed to inject logical knowledge inside a Neural Network in order to improve its predicting capabilities. This Thesis revolves around the idea of explainability... The Thesis is organized as follows: in Chapter \ref{chapt:explainability} we will discuss the concept of explainability in Machine Learning and the last developments in the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence. In Chapter \ref{chapt:kenn} we will then see in detail the theory and architecture behind KENN, together with experimental results. Finally, in (), we will see how KENN can be considered an interpretable and explainable model, we will express some results and discuss about future work.
